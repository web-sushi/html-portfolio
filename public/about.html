<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr/>
<p>I’m a dedicated and creative individual with a passion for storytelling, teaching, and technology. Based in Japan, I currently work full-time as an English teacher, helping junior high and high school students not only learn the language but also grow in confidence and curiosity. My experience in education has strengthened my communication skills and deepened my appreciation for cross-cultural connection. Outside the classroom, I’m a committed learner myself—constantly exploring new ways to grow through writing, programming, and language studies.</p>

<p>I’m also the author of a fantasy novel-in-progress titled Astromagia: Legacy of Starlight, a story that blends celestial magic, lost civilizations, and character-driven storytelling. Building this universe has allowed me to explore themes of memory, sacrifice, and redemption through richly developed world-building and mythology. I’ve also been developing plans to adapt my novel into other formats, including manga or manhwa, while preparing to share it through platforms like Patreon and web serial sites.</p>

<p>In addition to writing, I’m actively transitioning into tech and freelance work. I’m currently studying web development, JavaScript, and React, with plans to move into iOS app development in the future. My goal is to build a flexible and fulfilling remote career that supports my family and creative passions. Whether it’s through code, fiction, or education, I strive to create meaningful, inspiring experiences for others.</p>
